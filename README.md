# Data and AI Learning Resources

## Background
Over the last several years since 2013 or so, I have learnt statistical analysis, machine learning and AI from a number of free resources, and from books and videos I've paid for in short courses, and also a diploma program. This page is an effort to share some of these resources and help those who are interested in developing skills in data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## The Broader Context: What do data and ML mean to businesses in today's time?

Diego Kuonen (a thought leader and a tenured professor in statistical analysis and data science who I have connected with on LinkedIn and Twitter) has a fantastic set of slides on how to contextualize the data revolution. https://www.slideshare.net/kuonen/demystify-b-dafaaaeodtstatsoftwebinarmay142019 

## Basic statistics, databases, SQL and data visualization

1. There is a very good SQL course at Khan Academy. https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql 
2. This EdX course on PowerBI (took in in Feb 2017) was fantastic. Covered a lot of the skills you need to do data modeling, analysis and visualization on PowerBI https://www.edx.org/course/analyzing-and-visualizing-data-with-power-bi-3  
3. IBM has a nice course up on Coursera which deals with databases and SQL for data science  https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science 
4. There are many resources for learning data visualization. You should be able to download tools such as Minitab, Rapidminer, and of course you'll learn some visualization techniques within PowerBI. 
5. Rapidminer is a pretty good beginners' tool for data science and analytics: https://rapidminer.com/ - there are many learning resources and the tool is freely downloadable for small scale data analysis (you can easily analyze hundreds of MB of data with this tool on your laptop). 
6. If you want to learn another tool for BI and visualization I'd recommend looking at Tableau.

## Statistical analysis, data science and machine learning:

1. One of the best programs which teaches you data science from start to advanced skills, is the Microsoft professional programme in data science.  https://www.edx.org/microsoft-professional-program-data-science - took 7 of the 10 courses in 2017 and found them to be fantastic learning. The program covers basic stats, data visualization, machine learning, Python and R for data science. It is a complete package. Of note are the theoretically deep lectures by Prof. Cynthia Rudin in Principles of Machine Learning, where she explains some of the algorithms in depth.
2. Jay G Kearns' book Introduction to Probability and Statistics using R is a pretty good one. It is available free online.  http://ipsur.r-forge.r-project.org/book/download/IPSUR.pdf 
3. If you want to get deeper into Python, try Jose Portilla's Python bootcamp. It is on Udemy:  https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/
4. If you want to get deeper into R, try this course by JHU on Coursera. https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming - this is part of a 10 course specialization on Coursera on data science, which is really good. Link:  https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science 
5. I'd suggesting learning how to use Hadoop and big data tools like Hive on the cloud. There are many courses for learning these skills, I'll list some of them:
    - AWS solutions architect associate on Udemy https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/ 
    - Similar course, highly rated  https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/ 
    - Google Cloud fundamentals https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-fundamentals  
    - Azure cloud and big data:  https://www.edx.org/microsoft-professional-program-big-data 
6. If you want to get deeper into statistical machine learning theory, there are a few good books. 
There's the free books from Stanford - [Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/) and [Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by Gareth James, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and others. They have an associated course on statistical learning [here at Stanford Lagunita](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) 
7. One more superb book is [AIMA](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu) (Artificial Intelligence, a Modern Approach) by Russell and Norvig. It is not free but well worth picking up a copy. 
8. For practical machine learning using Python, you can check out this [very handy book by Sebastian Raschka](https://www.amazon.in/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka-ebook/dp/B00YSILNL0) 
9. Once you're comfortable doing basic Python (including Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, etc), you can graduate to doing large scale machine learning and data analysis on Apache Spark. There are a couple of good books, and there's [this course by Frank Kane](https://www.udemy.com/course/taming-big-data-with-apache-spark-hands-on/) - the instructor here has a lot of experience at places like Amazon and has built large scale recommendation engines and similar data and ML systems.
10. When you're ready to do really large scale machine learning and neural networks, you should take the [Andrew Ng specialization on Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) - it is very intensive and involves a lot of advanced ideas. There is a lot of code to be written and it gets quite deep. But it is totally worth it.
11. A good companion for doing machine learning with Tensorflow is this book by Aurélien Géron - [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492032646/) 
12. When you're ready to go deeper and understand other advanced machine learning techniques, you could check out this course: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml - course created by the National Research University in Moscow, and very technically deep, very good.
13. For time series analysis you can check out Rob Hyndman's book [Forecasting Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp2/) - he's an Australian professor who is one of the leading researchers in the area of time series. Here's another Australian dude who has prepared superb videos on time series analysis using R - [Ed Boone's R lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-n8PAnEbN0&list=PLtdHVw0YUd8Xkws3YExJtjrVFFFA6Mtno) 
14. Finally, I've recently (as of mid 2019) started the [Columbia PG Diploma in ML and AI](https://programs.emeritus.org/pgdmlai/), via Emeritus Global Ivy. It is a technically rigorous program which has been fantastic learning so far, much more impactful on my thinking about ML and AI than many of the practicum-oriented programs and specializations. In terms of content the program is quite rigorous and deals with the nuts and bolts of linear algebra and optimization for machine learning while not taking away the emphasis on application. All this make is a good recommendation for those interested in developing some true depth in this space.
